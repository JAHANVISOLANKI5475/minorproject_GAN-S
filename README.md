# minorproject_GAN-S
Any form of experimentation is heavily dependent on data and its quality. Lack of data in vision related problems is a constant due to various restrictions in data acquisition and the general availability of data. To account for this, we test the ability of GANs in producing new images in existing datasets and set a rigid experimentation guideline to see the performance of these models. We additionally add an explainability measure to see if the models are able to recognise the core aspects of the data. This will help in adding confidence to our model and end-users specifying that the synthetically generated data can act as a substitute to the original data.
